They are addressed to the State (not individuals), contain positive instructions (State must DO actions), and are non-justiciable in courts as per Article 37 (recommended by Tej Bahadur Sapru Committee). However, they are justiciable in the 'Court of the People' through elections and political accountability. DPSP promote social and economic democracy, reduce inequality, establish a Welfare State (Article 38), and encourage inclusive and sustainable growth. While fundamental in governance, they are not self-executory and require legislative implementation (e.g., MGNREGA, RTE Act). Article 40 served as the precursor to Panchayati Raj Institutions (73rd Amendment).",
