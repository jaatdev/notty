However, they are justiciable in the 'Court of the People' through elections and political accountability. DPSP promote social and economic democracy, reduce inequality, establish a Welfare State (Article 38), and encourage inclusive and sustainable growth. While fundamental in governance, they are not self-executory and require legislative implementation (e.g., MGNREGA, RTE Act). Article 40 served as the precursor to Panchayati Raj Institutions (73rd Amendment).",
